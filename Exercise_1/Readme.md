                            loading it into the HDFS.
                            
    Transforming:           This folder contains data transformations that were run 
                            using Hive.
                            
    Investigations:         This folder contains sql for answering primary questions, as 
                            well as text files containing the results.
                            Explanations for methodologies can be found at the beginning of
                            the text file for each investigation.
