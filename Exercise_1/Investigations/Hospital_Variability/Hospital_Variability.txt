In this file, I used the scores from procedures from the effective care dataset. Readmissions also 
had scores, but wouldn't make sense to use since it is only a subset of patients. The patient response survey data
did not include the different types of procedures or conditions, so for this reason it was also a suboptimal choice.

The effective care dataset sorted procedures with corresponding scores for various hospitals. In order to get variation
between hospitals, I took the maximum score, the minimum score, and computed a range for each procedure. This range
is reflective of the spread that occurs within a given treatment across hospitals.
