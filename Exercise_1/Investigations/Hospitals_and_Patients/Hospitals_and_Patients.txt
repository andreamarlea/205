Hospitals and Patients:
To measure weather average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability are correlated
with patient responses, I used the HCAHPS base score as a proxy for patient reponses. 
This score combines the metrics from the eight dimensions of the questionnaire to create a base
score for an institution. Additional documentation was found here:

To see whether average scores of hospital quality was correlated with patient survey responses,
I correlated the HCAHPS base score with the average effective care score of hospitals.

Results showed a weak negative correlation between these two items, specifically,
                              -.218317.
                            
To see whether variation of hospital quality was correlated with patient survey responses,
I correlated the HCAHPS base score with the variation of effective care scores for each hospital.

Results showed a correlation between these two items, specifically, 
                              -.436052.
                              
This indicates that, on average, patient scores tend to be lower when the care tends to be more 
variable. This is interesting, but makes sense given that a patient could have only one bad 
experience that greatly negatively impacts their perception of a hospital. Essentially, only
one very negative experience out of 10 procedures could leave the patient unsatisfied.
